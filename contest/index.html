    <section id="faq">
      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      Can anyone enter?
      As with any competition of this nature there are some restrictions. Employees of CenturyLink cannot enter, and laws in certain jurisdictions also restrict entrants. Due to some legal restrictions, people outside the United States cannot enter, nor can residents of the state of Florida. Believe us, we’d love to have you join in, but we’re not allowed to. We’d like to have a more inclusive challenge in the future. Please see the Terms and Conditions for additional details.
      I’m a developer outside the United States. Can I participate?
      No. Unfortunately, due to some legal restrictions, this contest is not available to developers outside the United States. Believe us, we’d love to have you join in, but we’re not allowed to. We’d like to have an international challenge in the future.
      I’m a developer in Florida. Can I participate?
      No. Unfortunately, again due to some legal restrictions, this contest is not available to developers in Florida. Believe us, we’d love to have you join in, but we’re not allowed to. We’d like to include Florida in the future.
      What kind of application templates can I create using Panamax?
      Your imagination is the limit. See some examples of templates in Panamax by searching "all" in the search box.
      Are there any ideas for kinds of application template types I should focus on?
      You can really do anything, but if you need some ideas, think of popular CMS and web frameworks (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, etc), open-source projects (Hadoop, Cloud Foundry, Cassandra, etc.), and Docker-related projects (Flynn, Deis, Dokku, etc.)
      What happens if I run into problems while using the Developer Sandbox?
      You can ask for help with other people using Panamax.
      IRC channel: http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=panamax
      Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/panamax_io
      Are there some references to help me get started?
      Learn about what we think are good templates on our Panamax Public Templates wiki page.
      Do I have to write documentation with my app template?
      Yes, how to use your app template is an important component of the challenge since you want people to be able to do cool stuff easily. The easier it is to use your template, the more likely you are to have a popular template that can win the best prizes.
